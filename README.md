Home Page :<br>
* The home page contains all the quotes fetching from API.<br>
* I am using infinite scroll. it makes the frontend load-free. at a time it fetches only 10-14 objects when the user scrolls again next 10-14 objects and so on
* I am using star rating npm for stars if the user rate quote 4 out of 5 or 5 out of 5 then the algorithm display similar quotes of user interest.<br>
* also, if the user rate quote 3,2,1 out of 5 then the algorithm display very different quotes as user disliked.<br>
* all these ratings get update and you can see them in your favorite section<br>

Rating Page :<br>

* User can see all his rated quotes in Top-Rated to Low-Rated manner.<br>
* also, update rating can also be added in the future easily.<br>
